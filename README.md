# Abdulmalik

Hi, I am Abdul-Malik Alegimenlen

As a data analyst, I love digging into data to uncover meaningful insights that help businesses make smarter decisions. I have worked with SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize data turning raw numbers into clear, actionable reports and dashboards.

What excites me most is finding the story behind the data and presenting it in a way that is easy to understand and act on. Whether it is optimizing queries, building interactive dashboards, or automating data processes, I enjoy the challenge of making data work for real world decisions.
