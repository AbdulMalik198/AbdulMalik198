# Abdulmalik

Hi, I’m Abdul-Malik Alegimenlen, a Software Developer with a strong foundation in web and application development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL, combined with a background in data analytics.

I enjoy building software and database-driven applications that turn raw data into useful, real-world functionality. My experience working with SQL, Python, and data visualisation tools allows me to design systems that not only run smoothly, but also produce clear, reliable, and meaningful insights.

What excites me most is solving problems through code — whether that’s creating a web interface, connecting it to a database, or writing logic that transforms data into something people can use to make better decisions. I’m passionate about building clean, efficient, and user-focused applications that make information easier to access, understand, and act on.
